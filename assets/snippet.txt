● LexiAgent: Autonomous Legal Document Analysis                                                                        Personal Project | 2025
• Challenge: Manual review of legal documents for clause extraction and risk detection is slow, costly, and requires
            expert-level legal knowledge.
• Action:
    • Built an autonomous multi-agent system using LangGraph, LangChain, and LLMs (Qwen, LLaMA 4) to mimic legal
    reasoning workflows.
    • Developed modular components for document classification, clause extraction, risk detection, and summarization.
    • Combined semantic search with rule-based logic to detect critical clauses (e.g., indemnity, liability, termination).
    • Integrated natural language querying, enabling users to interact with and extract insights from complex legal
    content.
• Result:
    • Automated 80% of legal review, cutting time from hours to minutes with explainable outputs.
    • Delivered a production-ready agent showcasing advanced LLM orchestration, tool integration, and prompt
    engineering. [Live Demo](https://lexiagent-ai-powered-autonomous-legal-document-analyst.streamlit.app/?embed_options=dark_theme)
